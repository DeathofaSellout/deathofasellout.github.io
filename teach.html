    <h2>Become A Full Stack Web Developer</h2>
    <p>There are a lot of careers in the world of tech, but this is a career
    where you infuse tech and creativity. People can see what you've created and
    you help change their lives for the better.</p>

  <section class="row">
      <div class="grid">
        <p> There are a lot of different roles in the tech world. For me, the most creative
          is Full Stack Web Development. You can create your own apps. You are only limmited
          by your own genius. Build apps to help people, build apps to help yourself, and/or build
          apps to make money. Whatever your decision may be, getting started can be rough. That's why
          I am passing on my knowledge. You can use the knowledge to completely
          teach yourself or use this path to establish a working knowledge of the javascript world to enter
          into a bootcamp.</p>
          <h1> Start with Javascript</h1>
          <p> It's really important to start with a programming language before you learn HTML and CSS. Why?
            programming is a lot harder to learn than HTML and CSS. The sooner you get started the better. Also,
            once you learn a language, it's a lot easier to learn other languages.
