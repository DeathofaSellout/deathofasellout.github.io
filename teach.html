    <h2>Become A Full Stack Web Developer</h2>
    <p>There are a lot of careers in the world of tech, but this is a career
    where you infuse tech and creativity. People can see what you've created and
    you can chelp change their lives for the better.</p>

        <h1>Web Development</h1>
        <p> There are a lot of different roles in the tech world. For me, the most creative
          is Full Stack Web Development. You can create your own web apps. You are only limited
          by your own genius. Build apps to help people, build apps to help yourself, and/or build
          apps to make money. Whatever your decision may be, getting started can be rough. That is why
          I am passing on my knowledge. You can use this knowledge to completely
          teach yourself or you can use this path to establish a working knowledge of javascript to enter
          into a bootcamp.</p>
          <h1> Different Tech Stacks</h1>
          <p> There are a lot of different Tech Stacks. A Tech Stack is a full stack of web technologies
            you use to build a web app, divided into Front End and Back End. Front End is what you see, Back End
            is where are all of the information is stored. A web app is a website like Facebook or Google. It's not the exact
            same thing as building an IOS app or Android app. Each of those are their own careers in tech.
            The two tech stacks that I am experienced with are Ruby on Rails and the MERN/MEAN tech stacks. Yes there are others,
            but focus on one, then you can learn any other. For now, we are going to focus on the MEAN/MERN stack.
            MERN stands for Mongo DB, Express, React, and Node js. MEAN stands for Mongo DB, Express, Angular, and Node js.
            These are Javascript based Full Stacks.
          </p>
          <h1> Start with Javascript</h1>
          <p> It's really important to start with a programming language before you learn HTML and CSS. Why?
            programming is a lot harder to learn than HTML and CSS. The sooner you get started the better. Also,
            once you learn a language, it's a lot easier to learn other languages.
