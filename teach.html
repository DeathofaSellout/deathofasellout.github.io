    <h2>Become A Full Stack Web Developer</h2>
    <p>There are a lot of careers in the world of tech, but this is a career
    where you infuse tech and creativity. People can see what you've created and
    you can help change their lives for the better.</p>
  </section>

      <div class="grid">
        <h1>Web Development</h1>
        <p> There are a lot of different roles in the tech world. For me, the most creative
          is Full Stack Web Development. You can create your own web apps. You are only limited
          by your own genius. Build apps to help people, build apps to help yourself, and/or build
          apps to make money. Whatever your decision may be, getting started can be rough. That is why
          I am passing on my knowledge. You can use this knowledge to completely
          teach yourself or you can use this path to establish a working knowledge of javascript to enter
          into a bootcamp.</p>
          <h2>Everything You Need For Your Journey</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Computer. Hopefully A Mac Or A Linux Machine</li>
            <li>Text Editor</li>
            <li>Github Account</li>
            <li>Terminal/CLI</li>
            <li>Google Chrome/Chrome Dev Tools</li>
            <li>Heroku</li>
            <li>Jshint</li>
          </ol>
          <h1> Different Tech Stacks</h1>
          <p> There are a lot of different Tech Stacks. A Tech Stack is a full stack of web technologies
            you use to build a web app, divided into Front End and Back End. Front End is what you see, Back End
            is where are all of the information is stored. A web app is a website like Facebook or Google. It's not the exact
            same thing as building an IOS app or Android app. Each of those are their own careers in tech.
            The two tech stacks that I am experienced with are Ruby on Rails and the MERN/MEAN tech stacks. Yes there are others,
            but focus on one, then you can learn any other. For now, we are going to focus on the MEAN/MERN stack.
            MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, and Node js. MEAN stands for Mongo DB, Express, Angular, and Node js.
            These are Javascript based Full Stacks. You will be using the MVC architechtural paradigm: Model-View-Controller.
          </p>
          <h1>Learn How To Work From A Command Line Interface/Linux or Unix based</h1>
            <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/bash">Linux/CLI</a>
            <p> You need to learn how to navigate your computer from a terminal. Using a Mac or Linux based OS provides
                you with a terminal, typically a BASH terminal. Creating files, directories, running a node server, installing
                everything you need for an app; all of this is done from a command line. Learn it, love it, use it.
            </p>
          <h1>Learn GIT</h1>
            <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/bash">GIT</a>
              <p> Learn GIT, by extension learn how to use github. This is where you store your projects. This is where companies
                store their projects. Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files, for coordinating work
                on those files with multiple people or for yourself.
              </p>
            <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>
              <p> This is the most prominent git repository. This is where you store your projects. This is where
                companies store their projects. This is where you can get ruby gems to use, where you can get premade
                MERN stack or MEAN stack templates. A place for companies look at your code to see what you are doing.
              </p>
          <h1>Pick a Text Editor</h1>
            <p>Either will work great. A text editor is for writing code, for creating your web apps. They both also
            allow you to run code in a console, to see if your code works or to see if there are errors.</p>
            <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text Editor</a>
              <p> I love the console I have set up in sublime. Great for running code really quickly.
              </p>
            <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom Text Editor</a>
              <p> Atom has a lot of really cool add on features. Love and hate it's auto completion.
                Can't go wrong with atom.
              </p>
          <h1>Using Google Chrome Dev Tools</h1>
            <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools">Chrome Dev Tools</a>
              <p>This is a link to learn how to use Chrome Dev Tools. You can open it on any website displayed on your
                 browser (Google Chrome Only). It allows you to have a console for testing code, to see errors, to examine
                 your HTML and CSS, to see what other websites code looks like. You will use it often.
              </p>
          <h1>Start with Javascript</h1>
            <p> This is the absolutely most important step in your whole journey, one you will work on your entire career.
              Start with a object oriented programming language before you learn HTML and CSS. Why?
              Learning an object oriented programming language is a lot harder to learn than HTML and CSS. The sooner you get started the better. Also,
              once you learn a OOP language, it's a lot easier to learn other OOP languages because a lot of them are the exact
              same concepts, just done differently with different syntax. Coding is hard, it's not easy. Spend one to two hours every day learning.
              You may hit a wall when you are first getting started, but know this: it will all make sense. It will also become
              a lot of fun. It's all about problem solving and becoming a better critical thinker. Well, where to start?
            </p>
          <h2>Sites To Learn Javascript</h2>
              <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">CodeAcademy.com</a>
                <p>CodeAcademy has a lot! You can do the free version or pay if you want help. I've done both.
                  I've used it for multiple languages, great way to get started. Just stick with Javascript.
                  After you've gotten a good handle on JS, then use it for HTML, CSS, and the Command Line. CodeAcademy is
                  the perfect way to get started. They give you a great basis to get started with.
                </p>
              <a href="https://www.hackreactor.com/prep-programs?utm_source=googlesearchnetwork&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=P_Search_Brand_Prep">Hack Reactor Prep</a>
                <p>You can do the free version or pay if you want help. I've done both.
                  This is a great way to solidify your skills and to move on to the next level. You won't be able
                  to make it into the program if you haven't solidified your skills on CodeAcademy.
                </p>
              <a href="http://jshint.com/">jshint.com</a>
                <p>This is a site that helps check your code to see if you are missing any of the basics. Such as
                  commas, semicolons, and parentheses. Seems trivial, but it is crucial when you are first getting
                  started. Always check your code if it's not running in your console/text editor.
                </p>
          <h2>Learn Higher Order Functions</h2>
            <a href="https://medium.com/humans-create-software/a-dirt-simple-introduction-to-higher-order-functions-in-javascript-b33bf9e19056">Intro to HOFs</a>
            <p> A HOF is a function that accepts another function as an argument. Fancy For Loops that do wondeful
              things for you. Learn them and love them. Also, the guy in the above article has a wonderful youtube
              channel that is great for learning about JS in all of it's glory.
            </p>
          <h2>Learn Recursion</h2>
            <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2002/cmsc214/Tutorial/recursion.html">Intro to Recursion</a>
            <p> Recursion is a rabbit hole you want to go down. It's a function that calls itself until it solves
              a problem by solving parts of a problem, one at a time. You need a base case and then a recursive call.
              Read the above article to start down the path of recursion.
            </p>
      <h1>HTML & CSS</h1>
         <p> Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is like the bones, the physical framework for your website. It's the
           text you are reading right now and how it is arranged. It's how your whole website is arranged.
           Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is the styling of your website. Changing how your text looks,
           how your images are presented, and the colors you see. CSS can also do more.
         </p>
      <h2>Sites To Learn HTML & CSS</h2>
          <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">CodeAcademy.com</a>
            <p>Once again, CodeAcademy has a lot! You can do their HTML and CSS courses. Start here. It will get you
               familiar with all of the basics.
            </p>
          <a href="https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/building-your-first-web-page/">Learn From Shay Howe</a>
            <p>This is an extremely thorough run through on how to build an elegant website with HTML and
               CSS. I highly suggest doing this after a CodeAcademy run through. It will take you to the next
               level.
            </p>
          <a href="https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/">Learn From Shay Howe Part 2</a>
            <p>This is an advanced and extremely thorough run through on how to build an even more elegant website with HTML and
               CSS, but adding jQuery and more. Extended from the previous example.
            </p>
      <h1>jQuery</h1>
        <p>jQuery is a javascript library. It helps bring your website alive, adding animation and interactivity to
           your website. It listens for events, like when you click on a button or push down a key, then it triggers
           an action! Not to get too in depth, just try the link below and take your JS to a whole new level!
        </p>
        <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">CodeAcademy.com</a>
          <p>You've got it, CodeAcademy! They have a great jQuery series. I've done other sites jQuery series, like
             codeschool.com, but they were hard to follow for me. Not as clear. CodeAcademy does a great job.
          </p>
      <h1>MEAN/MERN</h1>
        <p>A full tech stack that is everything you need to develop full web apps. There are two versions, because you
          can use either Angular or React for a front end framework. Typically you would only use Angular or React for
          large web apps, but start learning Angular or React after you've learned everything else listed on this page.
        </p>
        <a href="http://info-mongodb-com.s3.amazonaws.com/_com_assets/collateral/modern_app_stack_ebook_rgb.pdf">Complete Guide To MEAN/MERN</a>
          <p>This is an extremely thorough run through on the full MEAN/MERN tech stack. Pretty self explanatory.
             Great place to start. This will help you get a sense of how all of the technologies listed below work together.
          </p>
      <h1>Node js</h1>
          <p> "Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven,
            non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the
            largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world." - <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Nodejs.org</a>
          </p>
          <p>Node js is a server side technology. It's part of the back end of your web app. It is what talks between
            the front end and your back end database (Mongo DB).
          </p>
          <a href="https://courses.edx.org">edx.org</a>
            <p>Edx has a lot of courses, mostly free. You can pay if you want certificates. They have courses on
              every part of a full stack. They just use sql instead of mongo db for their database. Both are great.
              They have a node js course you can take for free.
            </p>
          <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_intro.asp">w3schools.com</a>
            <p> w3schools.com Is an exhaustive source for all things web. I constantly use them for quick CSS and
              HTML hints. This link brings you to their node course. Once again just like edx, they teach it in
              conjuction with sql.
            </p>
      <h1>Express</h1>

          </p>
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs">Mozilla's Docs on Express</a>
          <p> Express is the backend part of the stack. The above tutorial will help you work through your first express app.
              More importanly Mozilla Docs has documentation on everything Javascript. Bookmark that site.
          </p>
        <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs">EJS</a>
