  <p> There are a lot of different roles in the tech world. For me, the most creative
    is Full Stack Web Development. You can create your own apps. You are only limmited
    by your own genius. Build apps to help people, build apps to help yourself, and/or build
    apps to make money. Whatever your decision may be, getting started can be rough. That's why
    I am passing on my knowledge. You can use the knowledge to completely
    teach yourself or use this path to establish a working knowledge of the javascript world to enter
    into a bootcamp.</p>
    <h1> Start with Javascript</h1>
    <p> It's really important to start with a programming language before you learn HTML and CSS. Why?
      programming is a lot harder to learn than HTML and CSS. The sooner you get started the better. Also,
      once you learn a language, it's a lot easier to learn other languages.</p>
