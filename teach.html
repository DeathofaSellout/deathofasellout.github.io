    <h2>Become A Full Stack Web Developer</h2>
    <p>There are a lot of careers in the world of tech, but this is a career
    where you infuse tech and creativity. People can see what you've created and
    you can chelp change their lives for the better.</p>

        <h1>Web Development</h1>
        <p> There are a lot of different roles in the tech world. For me, the most creative
          is Full Stack Web Development. You can create your own web apps. You are only limited
          by your own genius. Build apps to help people, build apps to help yourself, and/or build
          apps to make money. Whatever your decision may be, getting started can be rough. That is why
          I am passing on my knowledge. You can use this knowledge to completely
          teach yourself or you can use this path to establish a working knowledge of javascript to enter
          into a bootcamp.</p>
          <h1> Different Tech Stacks</h1>
          <p> There are a lot of different Tech Stacks. A Tech Stack is a full stack of web technologies
            you use to build a web app, divided into Front End and Back End. Front End is what you see, Back End
            is where are all of the information is stored. A web app is a website like Facebook or Google. It's not the exact
            same thing as building an IOS app or Android app. Each of those are their own careers in tech.
            The two tech stacks that I am experienced with are Ruby on Rails and the MERN/MEAN tech stacks. Yes there are others,
            but focus on one, then you can learn any other. For now, we are going to focus on the MEAN/MERN stack.
            MERN stands for Mongo DB, Express, React, and Node js. MEAN stands for Mongo DB, Express, Angular, and Node js.
            These are Javascript based Full Stacks.
          </p>
          <h1> Start with Javascript</h1>
          <p> This is the absolutely most important step in your whole journey, one you will work on your entire career.
            Start with a object oriented programming language before you learn HTML and CSS. Why?
            Learning an object oriented programming language is a lot harder to learn than HTML and CSS. The sooner you get started the better. Also,
            once you learn a OOP language, it's a lot easier to learn other OOP languages because a lot of them are the exact
            same concepts, just done differently with different syntax. Coding is hard, it's not easy. Spend one to two hours every day learning.
            You may hit a wall when you are first getting started, but know this: it will all make sense. It will also become
            a lot of fun. It's all about problem solving and becoming a better critical thinker. Well, where to start?

          <h2>-Sites To Learn Javascript-</h2>
            <ul>
              <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">CodeAcademy.com</a>
                <p>CodeAcademy has a lot! You can do the free version or pay if you want help. I've done both.
                  I've used it for multiple languages, great way to get started. Just stick with Javascript.
                  After you've gotten a good handle on JS, then use it for HTML, CSS, and the Command Line. CodeAcademy is
                  the perfect way to get started. They give you a great basis to get started with.
                </p>
                <a href="https://www.hackreactor.com/prep-programs?utm_source=googlesearchnetwork&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=P_Search_Brand_Prep">Hack Reactor Prep</a>
                  <p>You can do the free version or pay if you want help. I've done both.
                    This is a great way to solidify your skills and to move on to the next level. You won't be able
                    to make it into the program if you haven't solidified your skills on CodeAcademy.

          <h2>-Learn Higher Order Functions-</h2>
            <a href="https://medium.com/humans-create-software/a-dirt-simple-introduction-to-higher-order-functions-in-javascript-b33bf9e19056">Intro to HOFs</a>
            <p> A HOF is a function that accepts another function as an arguement. Fancy For Loops that do wondeful
              things for you. Learn them and love them. Also, the guy in the above article has a wonderful youtube
              channel that is great for learning about JS in all of it's glory.
            </p>
            <h2>-Learn Recursion-</h2>
              <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2002/cmsc214/Tutorial/recursion.html">Intro to Recursion</a>
              <p> Recursion is a rabbit hole you want to go down. It's a function that calls itself until it solves
                a problem by solving parts of a problem, one at a time. You need a base case and then a recursive call.
                Read the above article to start down the path of recursion.

      <h1>HTML & CSS</h1>
        <p> Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is like the bones, the physical framework for your website. It's the
          text you are reading right now and how it is arranged. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is the styling of your website.
          Changing how your text looks, how your images are presented, and the colors you see.

      <h2>-Sites To Learn HTML & CSS-</h2>
        <ul>
          <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">CodeAcademy.com</a>
            <p>Once again, CodeAcademy has a lot! You can do their HTML and CSS courses. Start here. It will get you
               familiar with all of the basics.

            <p>This is an extremely thorough run through on how to build an elegant website with HTML and
               CSS. I highly suggest doing this after a CodeAcademy run through. It will take you to the next
               level.

          <a href="https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/">Learn From Shay Howe Part 2</a>
            <p>This is an advanced and extremely thorough run through on how to build an even more elegant website with HTML and
               CSS, but adding jQuery and more. Extended from the previous example.
            </p>
        </ul>
      <h1>jQuery</h1>
        <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">CodeAcademy.com</a>
          <p>You've got it, CodeAcademy! They have a great jQuery series. I've done other sites jQuery series, like
             codeschool.com, but they were hard to follow for me. Not as clear. CodeAcademy does a great job.
