        <h4> This is a social networking app that teaches a person how to
          become a full stack web
          developer. Create an account. Inside you have three pages that teach
          what tools you need to get started, what to learn in javascript, and
          where to go to learn how to build full stack web apps. There is
          a Forum where a user can ask questions and get help. There is a place
          to create Tasks to help keep track of what a user has learned and
          what they are working on. Finally, they can contact for me for help.
